# Project configuration

The project is created using `bun create vite@8.2.0` and selecting the `React + Javascript + SWC compiler` combo.

## Routing

Routing is handled by using `react-router@7.12` in declarative mode.

## Providers

Any provider for the react app is configured in [main.jsx](../src/main.jsx). For example the `BrowserRouter` provider for `react-router` this way.
